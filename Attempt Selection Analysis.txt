## Attempt Selection analysis

### Overview

I am competing in 2017 Raw Nationals (my third competition of that level) and I need to determine my attempts ahead of time to structure the peaking cycle. 
There are rules of thumb that I had used in the past (for example, first attempt should be the weight that I can relatively easy do for 3 reps in one set).
But I want to use the data to get some insights on how the best lifters do their own attempt selection. Maybe there is something that I can use for myself.

### Main caveats

While analyzing this database, I need to keep the below in mind:

- No data about meet preparation for all other lifters. Hence, I don't know how long their training cycle was, how often they trained, their best in the gym lifts.

- No data about lifters' state during the competition: did they do a big water cut? were they injured? were they in strong/focused mental state? etc.

- No data about their coaches and training programs 

All of the above are very big determinants of the performance during the competition. Hence, I will need to keep that in my mind while interpreting the results.
However, I do have this data for myself. Hence, I can combine qualitative data from my personal training with this analysis to figure out my own attempt selection strategy.

### Data prep

"USAPL_Comp_Data_Prep" contains steps for data import of csv files from Pulling_USAPL_competitions.py
In this particular case, we pulled Raw Nationals for 2014-2016 and combined 3 csv files into one.
Then this file was processed and outputed into csv.

### Data analysis

"USAPL_Comp_Data_Analysis" takes the csv file created with "USAPL_Comp_Data_Prep" and runs the analysis

### Caveats

This project is still in progress. More analysis to be added.
