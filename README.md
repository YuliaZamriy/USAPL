# USAPL Database Analysis

## USAPL Database overview

### What is USAPL? 

USA Powerlifting is one of the major powerlifting federations in the US. It is part of IPF (International Powerlifting Federation).
There are two main types of types of competitions within USAPL: raw and equipped.
USAPL maintains an online database with all the meet (competitions) results: [link](http://usapl.liftingdatabase.com)
It is updated on the ongoing basis. However, some of the old competitions (before 2014) don't have complete records.

### USAPL Database structure

All possible parameters within the database are listed in "usapl_parameters.txt"
For this analysis, we are going to focus on the Raw Division.

### What is USAPL competition structure? 

Each lifter competes within their weight class. 
In the full meet, each lifter performs three attempts for each of the main lifts: **Squat**, **Bench** **Press**, **Deadlift**
Best attempt is selected and summed into *Total*.
To compare lifters across weight classes, Wilks Score (*Points*) is calculated. 

## Goals of this analysis

### Overview

I am competing in 2017 Raw Nationals (my third competition of that level) and I need to determine my attempts ahead of time to structure the peaking cycle. 
There are rules of thumb that I had used in the past (for example, first attempt should be the weight that a lifter can easily do for 3 reps in one set).
But I would like to determine if there is a better way to do my own attempt selection.

### What is USAPL Raw National competition?

It is conducted once a year in October. Lifters need to qualify by competing in USAPL-sanctioned meet
